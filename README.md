## Work Experience

**Snappit (BigTam)** — *London, United Kingdom*  
**Software Lead (Part-time)** — *Feb 2025 – Present*  
- Designed platform architecture and developed **full-stack system** (React Native app, Android SDK in Kotlin, Next.js web app, Supabase, GCP).  
- Built custom authentication, DB schema, RPC (PostgreSQL), REST services (Node.js, Deno).  
- Implemented CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Fastlane, Docker), managed environment secrets with encryption (Blowfish, MD5, SHA1).  

**ION Mobility** — *Singapore*  
**Software Engineer/ Systems Test Engineer / Technical Project Manager** — *Jan 2022 – Sep 2024*  
- Continuous Testing:  I built CI/CD pipelines (Terraform, GitHub Actions, SSH) and automated hardware-in-the-loop test setup in Golang to improve the reliability of real-time control and IoT systems (ESP, Quectel LTE/GPS). This required me to write the test-cases to run on the HiL testbench.
- Diagnostics: I initiated and developed an integrated diagnostics tool in Rust to help engineers and technicians identify issues across OS, networking, and timing-critical logic. This evolved into an automated service tool (Rust for interface control, Python for running fault tree-analysis analysis/traversing logic) used in post-deployment servicing.
- Production Architecture: I designed the architecture to manage key and firmware data flow within the factory, leading the development of the individual tools and coordinating with production to test feasibility and speed of operation. (This included writing the proposal with user and technical requirements/breakdown, design, and integration testing.)
- Reporting: I created a log-based reporting framework that ensured traceability and clear routing of issues to relevant stakeholders, integrating seamlessly with our diagnostics stack.
- Workflows: I brought my teams onto Jira, adopting an Agile framework with tailored Scrum cycle to include integration, verification, and validation stages, strengthening delivery while accelerating bug resolution.
- Migrated teams to Jira, adopting an **Agile** workflow integrating V-Model, improving software delivery rate **>300%** and completing production-ready firmware suite 8 months ahead of schedule.  
- Developed company website (React, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, OAuth 2.0) and BMS/VCU firmware (S32K144, S32K118 RTOS, ESP32, Nordic 52834).  
- Developed BMS firmware (S32K144, Simulink), VCU firmware (S32K118 RTOS, ESP32, Nordic 52834).
-Led team of 8 engineers planned timeline, assigned tasks, and implemented task tracking and adopted agile lifecycle to enhance software features delivery rate by more than 300%, completing production ready firmware/software suite 8 months for an exhibition, doubling motorcycle pre-orders, and an investor showcase (Showcase led to buyout)
-Designed systems related factory production processes based on APQP adopting PFMEA to achieve 1.5min takt time

**Ministry of Defence, Singapore** — *Singapore*  
**Platoon Commander, Artillery HIMARS** — *Aug 2018 – Aug 2020*  
- Authored SOPs for a new communication system improving speed, security, and reliability.  
- Built a **safety reporting application** reducing reporting time by **60%**.  
- Led platoon to achieve **Cat A** (highest operational performance rating) in first exercise.  

**Shiro-Wa** — *Singapore*  
**Project Engineer** — *Feb 2018 – Jun 2018*  
- Developed mobile app (Kotlin) and deployment pipeline.  
- Designed SOP for new business venture and created product packaging (Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator).
